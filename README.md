# The Dles

"They call them the dles but they are anything but." - Northernlion

The dles is a curated collection of 400+ daily web games. A "dle" is generally a game that changes everyday which has the same version for everyone that plays, often taking inspiration from [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle). Dles are free and do not require a login or subscription.

View the app [here](https://aukspot.github.io/dles/) or view the list in a markdown table at the [bottom of this README](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#current-list-of-dles).

## Contributing

The easiest way to help the project is to suggest new dles by either filling out [this form](https://aukspot.github.io/dles/suggest) or [opening a "dle suggestion" issue](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/issues/new?assignees=&labels=dles+suggestion&projects=&template=suggest-a-dle-.md&title=Dle+suggestion).

If you'd like to make changes directly, you can edit [dles.json](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/blob/main/src/lib/data/dles.json) and do one of three things:

1. **Add a new dle**: copy and paste an existing dle in [dles.json](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/blob/main/src/lib/data/dles.json) and then change the information to that of the new dle and remove the id field. The id will be automatically assigned.
2. **Remove a dle** (if there's a broken link): delete the dle from [dles.json](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/blob/main/src/lib/data/dles.json).
3. **Fix a dle** (if there's a typo, broken link): Open [dles.json](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/blob/main/src/lib/data/dles.json), find the dle you'd like to fix, and make the changes you'd like to make.

## Features

You can suggest a feature by [submitting a feature request](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=).

### Current

- A list of over 400 curated dles.
- Ten categories to help with organization.
- Randomly choose and open a dle from selected categories.

### Planned

- Option to hide/show given dles.
- URL parameters:
  - to load a "playlist", an exact list of dles. (each dle must be in [dles.json](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/blob/main/src/lib/data/dles.json))

## Bugs

If you run into a bug, please [submit a bug report](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=).

### Development

The app is written in Svelte with SvelteKit. You will need to have `npm` installed.

To get started, clone the repository and go into the project's folder.

#### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Start development server

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

#### Building

When you're ready to create a production version of the project, run the following:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will update the `./docs` directory with a new build of the site.
